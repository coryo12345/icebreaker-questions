# icebreaker-questions
newlywed-esque style app to learn about another person. made really just for me to use

## TODO
### Stuff to do for "learning mode"

* [x] assign questions for game on game creation
* [x] show current question on game page
* [x] Give user the option to use their previously saved answer if it exists && != ''
* [x] Give user the option to save new answer as their answer for future games. (default = true)
* [ ] On submit, save user answer for game & optionally for user-answer if selected
    * If opponent has already answered for current question, increment current question
* [ ] somehow need to reload page content
* [ ] update game view to show status if you have already answered
    * either show "waiting for opponent"
    * or show confirmation screen to "see your opponents answer"
* [ ] Add confirm btn to confirmation screen to move to next question

### Stuff to fix
* Answers table inputs on second page (changing value moves you back to first page??)
* Loading indicators on all buttons while waiting for requests
